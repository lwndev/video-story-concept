## About

This project is intended as a proof-of-concept for a blog-post like format that allows for a music video and supplemental materials to be displayed together and which will display an overlay video player when the user scrolls the main video out of view.

## Dependencies

This project uses a Yeoman Angular generator so you should start by making sure that node.js and Yeoman are installed.

Node can be installed from http://nodejs.org

Yeoman is installed via npm
    
    sudo npm install yo

Once you have those applications installed and the repo cloned you'll need to pull dependencies via node and bower

    npm install
    bower install

## Running the app
    
When all dependencies are installed, you can run the project with Grunt

    grunt server
